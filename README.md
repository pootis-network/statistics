# statistics v3
Statistics V3 manager for Pootis Network, based off Fluffy Server's work.
## about statistics:
this addon will track your players stats (darkRP money, Dropzone wins, playtime, ip address, etc) into a SQL database.

# how to use:
1.  Obtain SQL Server with Remote SQL enabled.
2.  Install the Install.sql SQL file into the database.
3.  Install mySQLoo in the server you wish to install this.
4.  Configure db_config with your SQL Server's configuration and a ipstack.com API key.
5.  Start the server and join.

big shoutout to FluffyXVI for opensourcing most of Fluffy Server.
